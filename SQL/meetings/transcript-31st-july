And the concept that I want to start
3:48
start us talking about very first is SQL
3:52
server change tracking.
3:55
And the thing with SQL server change
3:57
tracking
3:59
is that the way we are configured our
4:02
standard at C1 is we preserve change
4:05
tracking for 7 days.
4:08
That means that any record that is
4:10
updated,
4:12
we will preserve that change tracking
4:14
record for 7 days.
4:17
The net effect of this for us is from
4:20
the very last run of any piece of our
4:22
ETL. We have 7 days
4:26
to let things pick up and run again
4:29
before we start having to look at doing
4:31
full reloads.
4:34
So
4:36
to bring this into reality for us and
4:38
why this is important is with these
4:40
sandbox environments we're currently in
4:42
a blackout window for the Avanti update.
4:46
Okay.
4:47
So we know that we can be down for at
4:50
most probably just be safe and say 6
4:53
days.
4:55
Given that we know within six days we
4:58
need to have everything run through.
5:01
And I'm going to be real with you guys.
5:04
We could easily do it in six days. What
5:05
I'm going to say is don't give yourself
5:07
that time. We need to give ourselves 48
5:09
hours. So I normally give myself 24 to
5:13
36 hours to do this stuff. I'm going to
5:15
say for now, let's talk in 48 hours. So
5:18
we want to carve out a 48 hour window to
5:21
make sure everything runs in dev, train,
5:24
and QA.
5:26
And so when I'm doing it by myself, I
5:29
typically start in dev and kick off once
5:31
daily. I let it run for a while and then
5:34
I'll go kick it off and train and kick
5:36
it off in QA.
5:38
The thing that we want to be mindful of
5:40
with what we're about to do is the
5:42
impact that we put on Avanti and the
5:45
impact we put on Netswuite. These are
5:48
the things that that we really have to
5:51
understand is those are SAS applications
5:54
and they have limitations.
5:57
Avanti's limitation is its proxy. It
6:00
will only allow a certain number of
6:01
connections. Once we hit that cab, and
6:05
that goes across all sandbox
6:07
environments, they share the same cab.
6:09
It starts to fail things. It starts to
6:12
deny connections. We don't have a hard
6:14
ceiling for what that cap is, guys.
6:17
It's
6:19
been, if I'm honest, kind of random. So
6:24
the rule of thumb I had is, well, I
6:26
normally allow two environments to run
6:29
at the same time at most for a
6:32
vontreple.
6:34
So
6:36
given that, I would normally kind of run
6:38
those in what I call a truncated
6:40
schedule. I would kick it off in one
6:41
environment, I'd wait for it to get a
6:43
ways through, and then I kick off the
6:45
next one, you know. So I probably let it
6:46
run for an hour or two in dev and then I
6:48
go kick off QA. Let it run for an hour
6:50
or two go kick off train you know and
6:53
just follow through doing things like
6:54
that. And then finally Magneto once once
6:58
every once once daily and once ovonte
7:01
repple have run Magneto just let her
7:04
rip. Uh I'm going to say this and then
7:07
I'm going to say we do need to pay
7:09
attention to the strain we put on
7:10
netswuite. However,
7:13
with magneto ETL, when it fails, it
7:16
suspends. With Breffle ETL, when it
7:20
fails, it moves on to the next asset.
7:24
So, because Magneto will suspend, we can
7:27
let it hit that ceiling with Netswuite
7:29
because it will stop itself and then we
7:31
can come back and restart that piece.
7:36
So, that being said,
7:39
what I'd like to see today is I want to
7:42
see us get through once daily in each
7:44
environment. I had intended to start
7:46
them yesterday, guys, but
7:50
by the time I got done with the
7:51
deployment yesterday, I had to step away
7:54
and was not able to get back and do it.
7:56
So, let's do this. I want each one of
7:59
you to pick an environment. So, somebody
8:00
take dev, somebody take QA, and somebody
8:03
take train.
8:05
What I would and I would like each one
8:07
of you to go just talk to each other and
8:10
say, "Hey, we're going to start in dev."
8:12
And then maybe in 30 minutes, an hour,
8:15
somebody's going to kick off QA
8:18
and then 30 minutes to an hour after
8:20
that, somebody's going to kick off
8:22
train,
8:24
right? And so the goal that I want you
8:26
guys to to focus on is
8:29
between now and when you leave Friday,
8:32
when you finish your day Friday, so your
8:34
normal finishing time, please, not not
8:35
beyond it. Um, try to have everything
8:39
run through in each environment.
8:41
If that doesn't happen, don't worry
8:43
about staying late and finishing it. We
8:45
still have time. Plan to come in Monday
8:49
and execute some of that. So you don't
8:52
have to sit here and watch it, guys. You
8:54
don't have to, you know, click on TF
8:56
Magneto prod. So, like what we would do
8:59
here. Um, you don't have to, you know,
9:03
click run on it and then go to monitor
9:06
and just stare at it and watch it. No,
9:07
just watch your emails, you know, just
9:09
pay attention to what's coming in in
9:11
your emails
9:12
and when you see an email related to the
9:14
environment you're working in, go
9:17
address it. Just go look at the
9:18
monitors, see what the error is. If
9:20
you've got questions, talk amongst
9:22
yourselves about it. If you're
9:24
uncertain, you can wait on me to get
9:26
back. You can you can send me an email.
9:27
You can send me an IM, you know,
9:29
whatever whatever would help you guys.
9:31
Um, I'd like us to try it this time
9:34
doing it this way. I know we're probably
9:36
going to run into some issues and I
9:38
think that's a good thing. I'm going to
9:40
start asking you guys to to look at some
9:42
issues and start troubleshooting. All
9:44
right. You got a question for what's up?
9:45
Yeah. So that means uh once we uh start
9:48
running these things the blackout will
9:50
be removed or uh just
9:53
the blackout's still there. So okay so
9:55
that's a good question. That's actually
9:56
a great question. Let's real real
9:58
quickly talk about how blackout windows
10:01
work in Informatica because I think
10:02
that's important to understand. Um
10:07
damn that's a good question for good
10:08
question. I'm glad you asked that. the
10:11
setup uh the set already set up
10:14
schedules will be paused only if you are
10:17
running manually it will right uh
10:20
you're dead on deine listen to this man
10:22
he knows his business so yeah that
10:24
that's exactly right the the way it
10:26
works is the blackout just keeps
10:28
schedules from executing that's it we
10:30
can still manually execute anything we
10:32
want
10:34
so in that regard blackout window is
10:37
very very useful for keeping things
10:39
quiet
10:41
and not letting the automations kick off
10:43
because that's really all it does is it
10:45
just suppresses schedules.
10:48
So
10:50
yeah,
10:52
so that means like uh each day we need
10:54
to go and keep running like the same way
10:58
what we doing planned today.
10:59
Okay. Okay. So another another fair
11:02
question. So what I will say is this.
11:05
We're not going to do it every day like
11:06
that. What we're going to do is you're
11:08
going to run each one independently,
11:11
right? So, we're going to run like I put
11:13
in the the body of this um of this
11:16
meeting invite. We're going to run
11:18
Yes.
11:18
once daily first, then avant reppel and
11:21
then magneto. Once we have all those
11:23
through one time, we just remove the
11:26
blackout period. What we do is we come
11:28
up here to blackout and we just uncheck
11:29
it
11:31
and click okay. and that lifts the
11:34
blackout window or we naturally let it
11:36
lift on August 5th. We'd probably prefer
11:38
not to do that. We'd probably prefer to
11:40
lift it beforehand. But with each
11:42
environment, once we run through the
11:44
first time the the orchestrations, we
11:47
can lift the blackout window. All we're
11:49
doing with this manual run of the
11:50
orchestrations is just ensuring that
11:53
we're paying attention, right? Because
11:55
what we don't want to do is we don't
11:56
want to let it naturally kick off and
11:58
have all three orchestrations running at
12:00
the same time and just errors are slowly
12:02
starting to trickle in, right? Because
12:05
here's the thing,
12:07
we're going to run once daily. Once
12:08
daily is going to hit every source
12:10
system we have. So if we have an Avanti
12:13
connectivity issue, because here's the
12:15
thing, Avanti just did an upgrade. There
12:19
is a good chance that they screwed
12:22
something up on their side. namely they
12:24
might not have remapped SIDS at the
12:26
database
12:27
and if they didn't do that it's going to
12:29
fail and we're going to have to open a
12:31
ticket and we need to know about that
12:33
sooner rather than later. We can run
12:35
everything that's not avant still but
12:38
Avanti is just going to be paused. That
12:40
in itself not a huge problem that we can
12:44
work around.
12:46
So we just want to test these things but
12:48
we don't want to
12:51
have a bad test. A bad test would be
12:53
just letting everything kind of run
12:54
naturally where there's a lot of
12:56
collision and a lot of resource
12:57
contention because then we're not
12:58
certain the failures are for the reason
13:01
you know that.
13:02
Let me rephrase that. We can't be
13:05
certain
13:07
that the failures were associated to the
13:09
upgrade in that case
13:11
because it could be resource contention.
13:13
It could be any number of things. Does
13:14
that make sense?
13:17
Yeah. And I have one uh
13:20
Yeah. Go ahead.
13:22
assumptions need to clear. So right now
13:25
this blackout we made because of uh
13:27
there is some updates happening in
13:29
theanti and uh so instead of uh
13:33
particularly for ivante objects. So
13:35
right now yanti objects are um
13:38
everywhere in all the schedules means uh
13:40
production once daily and all. So we are
13:42
blacking out for all the schedules and
13:45
then uh once after uh the update uh
13:51
completes and then we are just testing
13:54
it manually. Uh so is all the uh four
13:58
schedules are working properly or not
14:00
and then we are removing the blackout
14:02
period. Uh right Robert so
14:05
yep we just want to make sure do the
14:06
orchestrations work? Does everything
14:08
function as we expect it to? Uh and you
14:11
said that uh ripple components uh so
14:15
there is uh means uh if something is
14:17
failing uh some jobs are failing uh the
14:20
next uh job will trigger automatically
14:23
means uh like
14:26
so uh we made uh this one uh in purpose
14:31
for
14:32
correct very purposefully done this way.
14:35
Um and I will explain to you the reason
14:37
why very quickly. Um, so this this is
14:40
really should be pretty um let's see is
14:43
it B4 B3? I think it's B3. This one
14:47
should be pretty um pretty easy to
14:50
understand once I explain it is
14:53
if you think about these
14:56
objects in here. So each one of these
14:58
objects are truly independent of one
15:00
another.
15:01
What we're doing is we're saying, "Hey,
15:03
if incident fails, we don't want you to
15:06
not load item master. We just want to
15:07
skip incident and go to item master
15:09
because this is replication,
15:12
right? It's just replicating the data
15:14
from place to place." So, if we miss one
15:16
round of replication, whatever, we'll
15:19
pick it up on the next round. And we
15:21
have to be very thoughtful about that.
15:22
And that's why from here forward it uses
15:25
change tracking so that if something
15:27
like that does happen it doesn't disrupt
15:30
us downstream will catch up the next
15:32
run. So that was always the intention.
15:34
It was the we need to get what data we
15:36
can every run and we want it to not just
15:41
stop itself.
15:43
We want it to keep running. This is
15:45
where I'm lying to you is because this
15:47
guy will suspend. This subwork will
15:49
suspend guys with internally. That is by
15:52
design. Um, it doesn't happen very
15:55
often. When it does, it's not a big
15:58
deal. Ignore it. Honestly, you just go
16:00
stop things and the next time it runs,
16:01
everything will be okay. Um, this this
16:04
piece is becoming less important and
16:05
it's probably going to go away. But you
16:07
can see the way we're set up. If you
16:09
just look at the um at this piece right
16:12
here, this is where we're piping out and
16:14
we're just saying, "Hey, if you fail,
16:15
pipe this way and just keep running."
16:18
Yeah.
16:18
So, yep. It's very unique in this case
16:21
and it was built expressly for the
16:22
apology replication.
16:24
Okay. And uh we have to run uh once uh
16:29
once in a one because uh
16:32
correct
16:33
it will parallely process and it will
16:35
down the uh the timings mean
16:39
right we just don't we don't we can't
16:40
support the concurrency.
16:42
Ah
16:43
um so it's we just don't want things
16:45
stepping on one another. We want to have
16:47
it good and clean and bring things back
16:49
up nicely. That's all there is to it.
16:51
Uhu.
16:52
So, all right. Any more questions?
16:57
And
17:00
uh so after uh means one if we do uh so
17:03
sorry once again I am asking if we do
17:05
only one time means manually and then if
17:07
we remove the blackout it is fine means
17:10
after observing if everything is going
17:12
well. Yeah.
17:14
Yeah. And so, so once once we
17:16
successfully run everything, we remove
17:18
that blackout window, it's back to
17:20
normal operating, right? It's back to
17:22
the way things operate as usual. Um, and
17:25
that's the goal, right? Is to get there
17:26
as quickly as we can. Um, with as few
17:30
errors as possible, but we don't have a
17:32
lot of control over those errors, right?
17:35
So, that's where we are. Um,
17:38
yeah. Okay. Any any everybody
17:41
comfortable with what they need to go
17:42
do? Um, it I say Pine, why don't you
17:46
pick an environment and pick an
17:48
environment for the other two guys?
17:49
Somebody pick dev, somebody pick train,
17:51
somebody pick QA. And I'll make Pavine
17:53
be the bad guy so I don't have to be
17:55
this time. No, I got kids.
17:57
What I will say, guys, is train is
17:59
really easy. Okay.
18:01
Um,
18:01
the train environment doesn't have as
18:03
much stuff in it.
18:05
It doesn't have Netswuite, so it's a lot
18:07
faster run through. Um,
18:10
don't stress too much about train. Um,
18:13
you know, I I'd say
18:16
give it to whomever and, you know, next
18:18
time we do this, we'll switch it up and
18:20
somebody will we'll trade around who
18:21
gets to do what what environments so
18:23
everybody gets a chance to do uh the
18:25
ones that suck.
18:29
Now the how often these upgrades will be
18:31
happening uh like now it's only one uh
18:35
for other things like
18:37
probably be about once a quarter I would
18:39
say.
18:39
Oh, okay. Um it it we may have more
18:42
frequency on certain things but Avanti
18:44
is really the one that causes this. Um
18:47
none of the other applications
18:50
uh we don't do this for. Now Netswuite
18:52
we may but it depends. Um it's really
18:55
case by case guys and I'll walk you
18:56
through each one of those times uh when
18:58
we're getting to it to help you guys
18:59
understand how the decisions are being
19:00
made.
19:01
Okay.
19:02
And this SAS application means the
19:04
database we are managing the C1 is
19:06
managing or themsel they are managing
19:08
they they manage it. So, it's it is
19:10
owned by wholly owned by Avanti. We just
19:12
connect to it. Um, and in fact, that's
19:15
going to get really interesting in one
19:16
of the changes that are coming. I got an
19:18
email on it yesterday. Uh, I'm not going
19:19
to talk about it till I know more.
19:21
But, um, yeah, we're going to have we're
19:24
going to have a lot of not fun days
19:25
dealing with it. Um, to get things in
19:27
order. It it'll be it's going to be it's
19:29
going to be a thing. So, we'll cover
19:31
that another day because I don't want to
19:33
talk about it right now. I don't want to
19:34
think about it right now.
19:36
Okay.
19:37
It's going to be annoying. So,
19:39
regardless, we're going to we're going
19:41
to have a fun time. I'm just hopeful
19:43
that we can get into Fabric and get
19:44
going there so we don't have to worry
