Action Items from the Transcript:


Manual Execution of Orchestrations:

Each team member should manually execute the orchestrations (once daily, Avanti Reppel, Magneto) in their assigned environment (Dev, QA, Train).
Ensure the blackout window is lifted after successful manual runs.

Environment Assignments:

Assign environments to team members:
One person for Dev.
One person for QA.
One person for Train.
Pavine will assign these roles.


Monitor and Address Errors:

Monitor emails for errors related to the environment being worked on.
Address errors promptly and consult with teammates or escalate to Robert if needed.

Blackout Window Management:

Understand that the blackout window suppresses schedules but allows manual execution.
Lift the blackout window manually after confirming all orchestrations work as expected.

Testing and Observations:

Test orchestrations to ensure they function correctly post-update.
Pay attention to potential issues with Avanti connectivity due to recent upgrades.

Timeline:

Complete manual runs and testing by Friday's end of day.
If not completed, plan to continue on Monday.

Snapshot Write-Up:

Naveen to share the prepared write-up on the snapshot of transaction status with Robert for review and discussion after the daily standup.

Standup Sync:

Sync up after the daily standup for data analytics to review the snapshot write-up.

Future Upgrades:

Be prepared for quarterly upgrades, especially for Avanti, and understand the impact on orchestrations.

Coordination:

Team members should communicate and coordinate the timing of manual runs to avoid concurrency issues.
